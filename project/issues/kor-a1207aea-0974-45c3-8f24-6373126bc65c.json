      "text": "Create the `packages/web-component-wrapper` package. This is a small utility that takes a React component (or any framework's component) and registers it as a custom element (Web Component).\n\nThis is the critical bridge that makes federated modules framework-agnostic at the consumption boundary. Every app will use this utility to wrap its slot views before exposing them.\n\nThe wrapper should:\n- Accept a React component and a custom element tag name.\n- Register the custom element via `customElements.define()`.\n- Mount/unmount the React component when the custom element connects/disconnects from the DOM.\n- Forward HTML attributes as props.\n- Support a `Shadow DOM: off` mode (so host app CSS can style the shell slots consistently if desired).\n\n### Acceptance Criteria\n- A React component wrapped with this utility can be rendered in a plain HTML file using `<my-element>` syntax.\n- The component mounts when added to the DOM and unmounts when removed.\n- Attribute changes propagate as prop updates.\n\n### Dependencies\n- Task 1.1 (monorepo must exist first)",
