Configure each app with the Korporus App Runner URL as an environment variable or build-time config.\n\n- `apps/demo-react` → deployed to its own Amplify app.\n- `apps/demo-angular` → deployed to its own Amplify app.\n\n### Acceptance Criteria\n- Both demo apps are accessible at their Amplify URLs.\n- Each demo app loads the Hello app's federated modules from the App Runner container.\n- The full flow works: Amplify serves the SPA → browser loads remote modules from App Runner → Hello app renders.\n\n### Dependencies\n- Task 5.2 (needs the App Runner URL)",
