      "text": "Create a multi-stage Dockerfile at the repo root that:\n\n1. **Build stage:** Installs dependencies, builds the shell app, builds the Hello app's federated module bundle, and builds any other static assets.\n2. **Runtime stage:** Uses a lightweight base image (e.g., `nginx:alpine` or `node:22-alpine` with a simple static server). Serves:\n   - The shell app at `/` (the root).\n   - The Hello app's `remoteEntry.js` and assets at a predictable path (e.g., `/apps/hello/`).\n   - App manifests at `/manifests/`.\n   - (Future: backend APIs, but not needed for this POC.)\n\nConfigure CORS headers so the Amplify demo apps can fetch the remote entry bundles cross-origin.\n\n### Acceptance Criteria\n- `docker build` succeeds and produces an image under 200MB.\n- `docker run -p 8080:8080` serves the shell app at `http://localhost:8080/`.\n- The Hello app's remote entry is accessible at `http://localhost:8080/apps/hello/remoteEntry.js`.\n- CORS headers allow requests from any origin (for the POC).\n\n### Dependencies\n- Epics 2 and 3 working locally",
