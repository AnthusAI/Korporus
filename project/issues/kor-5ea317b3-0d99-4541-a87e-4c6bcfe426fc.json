Verify the shell boots, shows the Hello app icon, and clicking it loads the app into the shell slots. Change the language and confirm all three slots update.\n2. **React demo (Amplify):** Navigate to the React demo URL. Verify the Hello app loads and is interactive.\n3. **Angular demo (Amplify):** Navigate to the Angular demo URL. Verify the Hello app loads and is interactive.\n4. **Cold start:** Wait for the App Runner container to scale down. Access one of the Amplify demo apps and verify the loading/warming-up state works and the app eventually loads.\n\nDocument any issues found. Record cold-start times. Capture screenshots for the project record.\n\n### Acceptance Criteria\n- All three entry points render the Hello app correctly.\n- Cross-slot state (language selection) works in all three hosts.\n- Cold-start scenario is handled gracefully with user-visible feedback.\n- No console errors in any browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari).\n\n### Dependencies\n- Tasks 5.2 and 5.3",
