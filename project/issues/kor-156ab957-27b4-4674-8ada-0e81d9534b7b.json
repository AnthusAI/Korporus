      "text": "Add a standalone dev mode to `packages/app-hello` so developers can work on it independently, without running the shell. This is a simple HTML page (or React root) that mounts all three Web Components side by side, simulating the slot layout.\n\nThis mirrors how real app teams will develop: they build and test their app independently, then plug it into the shell (or any host) via the manifest.\n\n### Acceptance Criteria\n- `pnpm dev` in `packages/app-hello` opens a standalone page showing all three slot views.\n- Changes to the app's components hot-reload in this standalone mode.\n\n### Dependencies\n- Story 3.1",
