Validate the full end-to-end flow: user hits an Amplify demo URL → browser loads the SPA from CDN → SPA fetches federated modules from App Runner (waking the container if scaled to zero) → app renders.\n\n### Depends on\n- Epic 2 and Epic 3 (shell + toy app working locally)\n\n### Children\n- Task 5.1: Dockerfile for the Korporus container (after Epics 2 and 3)\n- Task 5.2: Deploy Korporus container to AWS App Runner (after 5.1)\n- Task 5.3: Deploy demo apps to Amplify Gen2 (after 5.2)\n- Task 5.4: End-to-end smoke test of the full deployment (after 5.2 and 5.3)",
