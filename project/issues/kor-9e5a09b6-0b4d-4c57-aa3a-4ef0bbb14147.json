      "text": "Build two minimal demo applications — one in Angular, one in React — that embed the Hello app's federated modules. These prove that the same app can run outside the Korporus shell, inside any third-party web application, using the same manifest and Web Component contract.\n\nBoth apps are hosted on Amplify Gen2 as static SPAs. They load the Hello app's federated module bundle at runtime from the Korporus container's URL.\n\n### Depends on\n- Epic 3 (the Hello app must be working as a federated module)\n\n### Children\n- Story 4.1: React demo app on Amplify Gen2 (parallel with 4.2)\n- Story 4.2: Angular demo app on Amplify Gen2 (parallel with 4.1)",
