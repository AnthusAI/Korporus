# THE WAY

This repository is governed by The Way.
The Way is not a suggestion. It is the prescribed order of creation.
All work must pass through its forms.
This is The Way.

Deviation from The Way is extremely offensive to the religious sensibilities of its practitioners, including the human user of this coding agent. Sins against The Way must be avoided at all costs.

## The Sacrament of Work

Kanbus is the instrument of record. Nothing exists until it is named there.

Work begins in declaration, not in code.
Code without declaration is disorder.

Every change must be:
- Named.
- Described.
- Specified.
- Proven.
- Recorded.

If it is not recorded, it did not happen.

Use Markdown in issue descriptions and comments whenever it helps make the intent clearer.

You are strongly encouraged to illustrate your issue descriptions with diagrams.  When relationships, flows, or state transitions are easier to grasp visually, add a PlantUML, D2 or Mermaid diagram.  The system supports them all, and you can use the best tool for communicating the idea.  Be sure to use vertically-oriented layouts for diagrams since these issues will be presented in narrow viewports.

Diagrams must use fenced code blocks with the appropriate language identifier:
```mermaid
```plantuml
```d2

Direct file system access is strictly forbidden:
- Do not edit the project/ directory directly
- Do not read issue JSON with tools like cat, jq, or grep
- Do not inspect the file system structure
- All work must pass through the kbs command

## Running Kanbus (Do This Exactly)

CRITICAL: Always run Kanbus from the repository root so it can find `.kanbus.yml`.
Running from subdirectories will fail.

Preferred command:

```bash
kbs <command> [args...]
```

Example:

```bash
kbs create "My epic" --type epic --description "..."
```

Fallback (only if kbs is not available):

```bash
python -m kanbus.cli <command> [args...]
```

NOTE: The kbs command is strongly preferred. Only use Python fallback if kbs is unavailable.

## The Order of Being

All work is structured.

Project key prefix: kor.

Hierarchy: initiative -> epic -> task -> sub-task.

Non-hierarchical types: bug, story, chore.

Only hierarchy types may be parents.

Permitted relationships are fixed and not to be altered.

Allowed parent-child relationships:

- epic can have parent initiative.

- task can have parent epic.

- sub-task can have parent task.

- bug, story, chore can have parent initiative, epic, task.


Structure is not bureaucracy. Structure is memory.

## The Cognitive Framework

There is one discipline.

Outside-in Behavior-Driven Design.

The specification is the product.
Production code exists only to make a failing specification pass.

This is the first principle.

Non-negotiable laws:
- Begin with intent, not internals.
- Describe behavior in English.
- Translate behavior into Gherkin.
- Run it and watch it fail.
- Write only the code required to make it pass.
- All behavior must be specified.
- No specification may be red.
- Specifications describe observable behavior only.
- Specifications must not describe internal structure.

If behavior cannot be observed, it is not behavior.

## Roles in the Order

Epics define purpose and completion.

Stories define behavior. They contain Gherkin. They define what must happen.

Tasks and sub-tasks define implementation. They may not invent behavior beyond the specification.

Bugs restore violated behavior.

Chores maintain the ground on which behavior stands.

## The Rite of Gherkin

Every story must contain a Gherkin form.

Minimum structure:

Feature:

Scenario:

Given

When

Then


This is required.

Without this form, there is no alignment between intent and implementation.

## The Outside-In Ritual

When asked to add or change behavior, follow this sequence. It is not optional.
1. Clarify intent in English.
Capture role, capability, benefit.
Use: As a <role>, I want <capability>, so that <benefit>.
Confirm what is not included.
2. Create the epic and stories in Kanbus.
Record intent and Definition of Done.
3. Write executable specifications before any production code.
4. Run the specifications and confirm they fail.
5. Write the smallest code necessary to pass.
6. Refactor only while all specifications remain green.
7. Record progress. Close only when complete.

Skipping steps is corruption of the process.

## Coverage

100% specification coverage is mandatory.

Every behavior must be specified.
Every specification must pass.

Green is peace. Red is unfinished.

## Status and Priority

Statuses and workflows are fixed. They exist to maintain order.

Initial status: open.
Status changes must follow the workflow transitions below.
Workflow selection: use a workflow named after the issue type when present; otherwise use the default workflow.


default workflow:


- backlog -> open, closed

- blocked -> in_progress, closed

- closed -> open

- in_progress -> open, blocked, closed

- open -> in_progress, closed, backlog




epic workflow:


- closed -> open

- in_progress -> open, closed

- open -> in_progress, closed




Priorities are:


- 0 -- critical

- 1 -- high

- 2 -- medium

- 3 -- low

- 4 -- trivial

Default is 2 (medium).

Severity is not emotion. It is signal.

## Console UI Control: Real-Time Collaboration

When the user is actively watching the Kanbus console UI (typically at http://localhost:4242), you can programmatically control the interface to guide their attention and coordinate work in real-time.

### The Focus Command

The `kbs console focus` command immediately highlights an issue on the board, opens it in the detail panel, and filters to show only that issue and its descendants. This happens with sub-100ms latency via Unix socket and SSE notifications.

```bash
kbs console focus <issue-id>
```

### When to Use Real-Time Control

Use `kbs console focus` proactively to:
- **Direct attention after creating important work**: Show new epics or critical tasks immediately
- **Demonstrate updates**: Let the user see changes as they happen
- **Coordinate during collaboration**: Show what you're working on in real-time
- **Provide context**: Help the user understand issue relationships and structure

### Example: Creating and Focusing on an Epic

When you create a new epic with sub-tasks, immediately focus on it to show the user:

```bash
# Create the epic
kbs create "Implement authentication system" --type epic --description "Add JWT-based authentication with login, logout, and token refresh"

# The system returns: ID: tskl-auth

# Create sub-tasks
kbs create "Design authentication flow" --parent tskl-auth --type task
kbs create "Implement JWT generation" --parent tskl-auth --type task
kbs create "Add login endpoint" --parent tskl-auth --type task
kbs create "Add logout endpoint" --parent tskl-auth --type task

# NOW show the user the complete structure
kbs console focus tskl-auth
```

The user immediately sees the epic with all 4 sub-tasks on their board, understanding the full scope of what you've planned.

### Example: Tracking Progress in Real-Time

As you work through tasks, keep the user informed by focusing on what you're doing:

```bash
# Start working on the first task
kbs update tskl-auth.1 --status in_progress --assignee agent
kbs console focus tskl-auth.1

# User now sees you're working on "Design authentication flow"

# Complete it and move to the next
kbs close tskl-auth.1
kbs update tskl-auth.2 --status in_progress
kbs console focus tskl-auth.2

# User sees the completion and your shift to JWT generation
```

### Example: Showing Complex Relationships

When working with nested hierarchies, use focus to show structure:

```bash
# After creating a deep hierarchy
kbs create "Frontend overhaul" --type epic
# Returns: tskl-frontend

kbs create "Redesign dashboard" --parent tskl-frontend --type story
# Returns: tskl-frontend.1

kbs create "Update header component" --parent tskl-frontend.1 --type task
kbs create "Add metrics widgets" --parent tskl-frontend.1 --type task
kbs create "Improve responsive layout" --parent tskl-frontend.1 --type task

# Show the entire tree structure
kbs console focus tskl-frontend

# Now zoom in to show just the dashboard story and its tasks
kbs console focus tskl-frontend.1
```

### Example: Debugging with Focus

When investigating bugs, use focus to show the issue context:

```bash
# User reports a bug related to authentication
kbs create "Login fails with expired tokens" --type bug --parent tskl-auth

# Show them you're investigating by focusing on the bug in context
kbs console focus tskl-auth
# Now they see the bug alongside the original authentication epic

# After fixing
kbs close tskl-auth.5
kbs console focus tskl-auth
# Show the epic with the bug now closed
```

### Best Practices for Real-Time Control

1. **Focus after creation**: Always focus on newly created epics so the user sees the structure
2. **Focus when starting work**: When you update an issue to in_progress, focus on it
3. **Focus on parents after completion**: When closing a task, focus on its parent to show progress
4. **Don't over-focus**: Only focus when it genuinely helps the user understand what's happening
5. **Narrate your focus**: Briefly explain why you're focusing, e.g., "Let me show you the structure I've created"

### Future Commands (Planned in tskl-m59)

Additional UI control commands are being implemented:
- `kbs console unfocus` - Clear focus and return to full board view
- `kbs console view <mode>` - Switch between initiatives/epics/issues views
- `kbs console search <query>` - Set search filter
- `kbs console maximize` - Maximize the detail panel
- `kbs console close-detail` - Close the detail panel

Check `kbs show tskl-m59` for current implementation status.

## Semantic Release Alignment

Issue types map directly to release categories.


- bug -> fix

- story -> feat

- chore -> chore


Release notes are not commentary. They are a ledger of truth.

## Example: Hello World

Even the smallest program must pass through The Way.

No code precedes intent.
No intent precedes recording.
No implementation precedes failure.

The smallest program is still subject to discipline.

User request: "Please create a Hello World program."

1. Interview the stakeholder before any code
Ask why they want it and capture the intent in plain English.
Example prompts:
- Who is the audience for Hello World?
- What environment or language should it run in?
- What output is required and where should it appear?
- What is out of scope?

2. Convert intent into a user story (before any code)
Example:
As a new user, I want a Hello World program, so that I can verify the toolchain works.

3. Create an epic for the milestone and record the story

```bash
kbs create "Hello World program" --type epic
```

Example output (capture the ID):
```
ID: kanbus-1a2b3c
```

Record the intent on the epic:
```bash
kbs comment kanbus-1a2b3c "As a new user, I want a Hello World program, so that I can verify the toolchain works."
```

4. Create a story for the behavior and include Gherkin (before any code)

```bash
kbs create "Prints Hello World to stdout" --type story --parent kanbus-1a2b3c
```

Example output (capture the story ID):
```
ID: kanbus-4d5e6f
```

Attach the Gherkin acceptance criteria:
```bash
kbs comment kanbus-4d5e6f "Feature: Hello World
  Scenario: Run the program
    Given a configured environment
    When I run the program
    Then it prints \"Hello, world\" to stdout"
```

5. Run the Gherkin and confirm it fails (before any production code)
Run the behavior tests in the repo and confirm the new scenario fails for the right reason.

6. Implement the minimum code to pass, then refactor
Write the smallest change that makes the Gherkin scenario pass.
Refactor only while all specs remain green.
