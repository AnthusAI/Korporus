The **shell** starts and fetches app manifests from a known set of URLs\n2. Each manifest describes an app: its name, icon, and the Web Component tag names for its three slots (titlebar, main, settings)\n3. When a user opens an app, the shell uses the **Module Federation runtime** to dynamically import the app's `remoteEntry.js`\n4. The remote entry's `bootstrap` module registers the app's **Web Components** as custom elements\n5. The shell creates instances of those custom elements and mounts them in the appropriate layout slots\n\n## Sections\n\n- [Module Federation](./module-federation) — How MF2 works in Korporus\n- [Web Components](./web-components) — The slot contract\n- [Shell](./shell) — Shell app internals\n- [Manifests](./manifests) — App manifest schema and discovery\n"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
